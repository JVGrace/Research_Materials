Crop disease detection in Tomato leaf using STN- CNN model Crop diseases pose a significant threat to global food security, and early detection is crucial for effective disease management. In this study, we propose a novel approach for crop disease detection in tomato leaves using a Spatio-Temporal Network ( STN) combined with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. The STN-CNN model leverages the spatio-temporal patterns of disease progression in plant leaves, enhancing the detection accuracy and robustness.

Tomato crops are particularly susceptible to various diseases that can impair tomato production. Timely recognition of tomato leaf diseases plays a vital role in protecting tomato crops from severe damage. In recent years, deep learning techniques, specifically CNNs, have shown remarkable progress in image classification tasks. However, traditional CNN models will be able to fully capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of disease development in plant leaves.

The implementation of the STN-CNN model for crop disease detection in tomato leaf represents a significant advancement in agricultural technology. By leveraging deep learning techniques, the model achieves accurate identification and classification of tomato leaf diseases. With a high accuracy rate of 90%, the model enables early detection and intervention, leading to improved crop health and reduced losses for farmers. The integration of image preprocessing techniques and the utilization of the pre-trained Xception CNN model enhance the system's adaptability and feature extraction capabilities, resulting in reliable disease classification. The STN-CNN model offers a practical solution for farmers and agricultural experts, aiding in effective crop management and disease control.
